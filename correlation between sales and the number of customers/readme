Sales and Customers Correlation Analysis
This script analyzes the correlation between sales and customer count in a retail dataset.
Requirements:
Python 3
Pandas
Matplotlib
Data:
train.csv: Contains sales and customer data. Expected columns include:
Date: Date of sales (string or datetime format).
Sales: Amount of sales for the day.
Customers: Number of customers on the day.
store.csv: Contains information about individual stores (optional). Expected columns include:
Store: Store ID.
Other columns: Store-specific information (e.g., store type, size).
Usage:
Replace placeholders:
Replace /path/to/train.csv with the actual path to your training data.
Replace /path/to/store.csv with the path to the store data file if you need to use it.
Run the script: Execute the script from your terminal using python correlation_analysis.py.
Output:
Correlation coefficient: The script will print the correlation coefficient between sales and customers.
Scatter plot: A scatter plot visualizing the relationship between sales and customers will be generated.
Explanation:
Import libraries: Import pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for plotting.
Load data: Load the train and store datasets using pandas' read_csv() function.
Convert date: If the 'Date' column is in string format, convert it to datetime format.
Merge data (optional): If you need to use store-specific information, merge the train and store data using pd.merge().
Handle missing values: Check for missing values in the 'Sales' and 'Customers' columns and handle them (e.g., using dropna()).
Calculate correlation: Calculate the correlation between 'Sales' and 'Customers' using pandas' corr() function.
Print correlation: Print the correlation coefficient.
Visualize: Generate a scatter plot using matplotlib to visualize the relationship between sales and customers.
Notes:
The script assumes that the datasets are in CSV format. Modify the file reading code if you have data in a different format.
The script provides a basic correlation analysis. You may want to further investigate the relationship between sales and customers, including considering other factors (e.g., store size, promotions, seasonality) and using more sophisticated statistical methods.
